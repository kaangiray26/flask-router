# vanilla-router
The unofficial Router for vanilla Javascript

## Quick Start

To use the router, just add the following script:
```
<script src="https://cdn.buzl.uk/router.min.js"></script>
```

Then, create a router-view element where you want the content to be displayed.
```
<router-view></router-view>
```

Finally, add a link with a route attribute.
```
<a href="/home.html" route>Home</a>
```

The router will automatically handle the rest. That's it! Enjoy!
